# Send/Receive SMS
Are one of those people that can't or won't carry a smartphone all the time? Do you still want to tell Homey to turn on the oven? Look no further! You can now command Homey to cater your every whim by SMS! With this plugin, you can even let Homey give you a call when your girlfriend escapes from the kitchen!

If you just want home to cheaply send text messages to your phone, take a look at the [Send SMS](https://apps.athom.com/app/com.gruijter.sms) app by Robin Gruijter. If you want more functionality, read on!

## You can:
* Receive text messages with Homey
* Control Homey through your dumb phone
* Send and receive _voice_, _text_ and _flash_ messages
* Check if the recipient really received the message
* Monitor your credit balance so you're never out of credits
* Send 8 free messages to a single phone
* Receive _unlimited_ free text messages from a single phone
 * * Phone provider charges still apply of course
 * * Receiving messages from extra phones require you to send a single message to the phone. You just need a single credit per phone!

## Note:
Currently only supports [MessageBird](https://www.messagebird.com). If you know any other gateway service that has an API for _receiving_ messages, let me know!
